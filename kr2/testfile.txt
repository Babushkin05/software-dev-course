To be honest, it's much worse there ðŸ™ˆ I've been living with this burden for 17 years... Maybe if I tell you, it will make me feel better?

Actually, a professor, my academic supervisor, took this book from the university library for me. The book was only for work in the reading room... He took it for me on his own responsibility (I was writing a dissertation and I needed to touch on the history of computer science).

I promise to go to Krasnoyarsk this summer and return it.
